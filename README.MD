The following serialEM scripts are used by the Jensen group to collect FISE tomography data:

1-Jensen_FISE.txt

2-GetEucentricHeight.txt

3-GetCalibrations.txt


Notes:

-Each script must be loaded into serialEM to function correctly

-Only the FISE script settings need to be changed before a run.

-Users must place the ArrayTilt_angles.txt and ArrayTilt_defoci.txt files in the working directory. 
Some examples are included here, but should be specific to your project.
