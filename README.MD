The following serialEM scripts are used by the Jensen group to collect FISE tomography data:
1-Jensen_FISE.txt
2-GetEucentricHeight.txt
3-GetCalibrations.txt
They must all be inserted into serialEM scripts to be used correctly.
Only the FISE script settings need to be changed before a run.
Users must place the ArrayTilt_angles.txt and ArrayTilt_defoci.txt files in the working directory. Some examples are included here, but should be specific to your project.
